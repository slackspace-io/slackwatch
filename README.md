# SlackWatch: Your Kubernetes Container Guardian ðŸš€

### Features
- Notify you of new versions of your container images by comparing semver tags.
- Check for updates on a configured schedule.
- Authenticate with your container registry assuming standard docker registry auth behaviours.
- Trigger automated upgrade by commiting new tag to your gitops repo, if you have configured a gitops repo.
- Use include/exclude regex patterns to filter out images you are not interested in, these are set as annotations on the deployment.
- Notify you of new versions, as well sucessful commits via ntfy.
- A Web UI to view the status of your images, and trigger automated upgrades.

## What is SlackWatch?
Slackwatch is under heavy development. It is not yet ready for production use. I personally am using it, including the automated upgrade feature, but I am not recommending it for others yet.

I started slackwatch to solve my own problem of keeping track of container versions in my kubernetes cluster at home. I was usually notified by noticing a new release on github, but this did not mean the image was actually available.

I did try to use other tools, but they didn't quite fit my needs. I was primarily interested in comparing tag versions, since I do not run :latest on majority of my workloads. I also then liked the idea of triggering a commit to my gitops repo to trigger an upgrade.

I initially wrote this in go+nextjs, but decided this was a good opportunity to begin learning rust.

I am not saying rust is the best choice for this project, but I am enjoying learning it.

The stack now, and going forward is planned to be rust + using dioxus as the web framework.

## Quick Start Guide

## Deployment (Into Kubernetes)

SlackWatch is Kubernetes-native and is intended to be deployed directly within your cluster. 
Check out the Kubernetes manifests in the `k8s` directory for deployment configurations. These are working files for Rancher Fleet, but should be easily adoptable to other methods.




### Prerequisites for running locally or developing

- Kubernetes cluster accessible from your local machine
- rust installed
- dioxus-cli installed, dx binary in your path.

### Deploying Slackwatch locally
- Deploy using references k8s files under k8s directory
- Run docker locally for testing
- Run `dx serve --platform fullstack` to start locally. Will use local kube-config. 

### Setting Up Slackwatch for development

1. **Clone the repository** to get started.
2. **Navigate to the git directory**: 
3. **Install dependencies**: Run `dx serve --platform fullstack` 

## Configuration

SlackWatch is designed to be highly configurable to fit your specific needs. You can adjust settings such as Kubernetes cluster details, notification channels, and more in the `config.yaml` file located in the backend directory.

```toml
[system]
schedule = "0 0 9-22/2 * * *"
data_dir = "/app/slackwatch/data"

[notifications.ntfy]
url = "http://localhost:9090"
topic = "slackwatch"
priorty = 1
reminder = "24h"
#The ntfy token should be an env variable named SLACKWATCH_NOTIFICATIONS.NTFY.TOKEN in k8s


[[gitops]]
##should match annotation on pod. This acts as a key to which gitops repo to use.
name = "fleet-slack-house"
repository_url = "https://github.com/slackspace-io/slackwatch.git"
branch = "main"
##k8s secret env variable which has your git repo's token
access_token_env_name = "SLACKWATCH_TOKEN"
commit_message = "Updated by slackwatch"
commit_name = "slackwatch"
commit_email = "slackwatch@slackspace.io"



```
