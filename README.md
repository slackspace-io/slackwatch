## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Node.js and npm for the frontend

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Clone the repository** to get started.
2. **Navigate to the backend directory**: `cd backend`.
3. **Build the Go application**: Run `go build -o slackwatch-backend`.
4. **Run the backend**: Execute `./slackwatch-backend`. This starts the backend server, which begins monitoring your Kubernetes cluster.

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**: From the root of the repository, `cd frontend`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to get all the necessary packages.
3. **Start the development server**: Execute `npm run dev`.
4. **Open your browser** and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the SlackWatch dashboard.

## Configuration

SlackWatch is designed to be highly configurable to fit your specific needs. You can adjust settings such as Kubernetes cluster details, notification channels, and more in the `config.yaml` file located in the backend directory.

```yaml
kubernetes:
  pollingInterval: 30
  useInClusterConfig: true
notifications:
  ntfy:
    url: "http://ntfy.sh"
