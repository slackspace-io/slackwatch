# Project Overview

## Note
I'm tossing AI at the wall until I get a working POC, then will refactor and clean up the mess :) It's a combination of wanting to solve a problem I have, and also test the different AI tools. I am primarily using cursor.sh pro, and chatGPT open AI together. 

I am building this with Go for the backend and svelte for the frontend at the moment, neither of which i've used in the past. 
Hopefully get a bare bones working to monitor containers, compare against repo, and notify on one notification channel. That will be flagged by a version, then i'll start working in a dev release. Until then latest is often and frequently broken. 

(Even the readme below was generated by AI..I told it not so serious and this is what it came up with..)

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a tool that allows you to monitor containers within your Kubernetes cluster, comparing them against external repositories to identify newer versions. It aims to streamline the process of keeping your containerized applications up-to-date by notifying you when a newer version of a container image is available. This ensures that you can take timely action to update your deployments, maintaining the security and efficiency of your applications.

## Status

This project is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing features and refining the system to ensure it meets the needs of users looking to streamline their container update processes. As it stands, the project includes a Go-based backend for processing and comparison logic, and a Svelte-based frontend for a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage notifications.

## Features

- **Container Monitoring**: Automatically monitor the containers running in your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Version Comparison**: Compare the current container images against external repositories to check for newer versions.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications when newer container versions are available, allowing for prompt updates.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Designed to run within a Kubernetes environment, making it a seamless part of your cluster management toolkit.

## Future Plans

As we continue to develop this project, we aim to introduce more features and improvements, such as:

- Enhanced notification mechanisms for better integration with existing DevOps tools.
- Improved UI/UX in the frontend for easier management and monitoring.
- Advanced filtering and selection options to customize monitoring based on specific needs.

## Contributing

This project is in its early stages, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, your help can make a significant difference in bringing this project to fruition.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License. We encourage you to use, modify, and distribute it as you see fit.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress in making container version monitoring more accessible and efficient.
